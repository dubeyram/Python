### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Threads:** Lightweight, share memory, good for I/O, limited CPU parallelism.
2. **Processes:** Heavy, separate memory, true CPU parallelism, need IPC for communication.
3. **Pools:** Reuse threads/processes, manage tasks and results easily, limit max workers, reduce overhead.
4. **Futures:** Provide safe and convenient access to task results, exceptions, and status.
