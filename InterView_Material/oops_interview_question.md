1. What is OOPs?
OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. OOPs is based on several key concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles help in organizing code, promoting reusability, and making it easier to manage complex software systems.

2. What are the main principles of OOPs?
The main principles of OOPs are:
- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).
- Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing classes to promote code reuse.
- Polymorphism: Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object.

3. What is a class and an object?
- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
- An object is an instance of a class. It is created based on the class definition and can hold specific values for the attributes defined in the class.

4. What is inheritance in OOPs?
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOPs that allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

5. What is polymorphism in OOPs?
Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to perform different functions based on the object that invokes them, enabling flexibility and scalability in code.

6. What is encapsulation in OOPs?
Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse of the data.

7. What is abstraction in OOPs?
Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand the intricate workings of the underlying code.

8. What are constructors in OOPs?
Constructors are special methods in a class that are automatically called when an object of the class is created. They are typically used to initialize the attributes of the object. In Python, the constructor method is defined using the `__init__` method.

9. What is method overriding in OOPs?
Method overriding is a feature in OOPs that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When the method is called on an object of the subclass, the overridden method in the subclass is executed instead of the one in the superclass.

10. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables?
- Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any instance methods. Changes made to class variables affect all instances of the class.
- Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within instance methods and are typically initialized in the constructor. Changes made to instance variables only affect the specific instance they belong to.

11. What is multiple inheritance in OOPs?
Multiple inheritance is a feature in OOPs that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from more than one superclass. This enables a subclass to combine functionalities from multiple parent classes, but it can also lead to complexity and ambiguity, such as the "Diamond Problem."

12. What is the difference between composition and inheritance?
- Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) derives properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass).
- Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, allowing for a "has-a" relationship. Composition promotes code reuse by combining simple objects to create more complex ones without relying on inheritance.

13. MRO (Method Resolution Order) in OOPs?
MRO (Method Resolution Order) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes when a method is called on an object. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, which ensures a consistent and predictable order of method resolution, especially in cases of multiple inheritance.

14. What are magic methods in OOPs?
Magic methods, also known as dunder methods (double underscore methods), are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). They allow you to define the behavior of your objects for built-in operations, such as initialization, string representation, and arithmetic operations.

15. What is an abstract class in OOPs?
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. Abstract classes are used to define a common interface for a group of related classes.

16. METHOD OVERLOADING AND METHOD OVERRIDING
- Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (different type or number of parameters). Python does not support method overloading directly, but it can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments.
- Method Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When the method is called on an object of the subclass, the overridden method in the subclass is executed instead of the one in the superclass.

17. What is a singleton class in OOPs?
A singleton class is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. In Python, a singleton can be implemented by overriding the `__new__` method or using decorators or metaclasses.

18. Monkey patching in OOPs?
Monkey patching is a technique in OOPs where you modify or extend the behavior of a class or module at runtime without altering the original source code. This can be done by adding new methods or attributes, or by overriding existing ones. While monkey patching can be useful for quick fixes or testing, it should be used with caution as it can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain.

19. Multilevel and Hierarchical Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class (subclass) inherits from another class (superclass), which in turn inherits from another class. This creates a chain of inheritance.
- Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance where multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
- Multiple Inheritance is a feature in OOPs that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from more than one superclass.
